    Batches are sets of SMS messages. You can send a single message or many. Batches are queued and sent at the rate limit in First-In-First-Out order.

     If you want more in-depth knowledge about SMS in general please read the [API Overview](/docs/sms/api-reference/).

    The REST API uses message statuses and error codes in delivery reports, which refer to the state of the SMS batch and can be present in either [Retrieve a delivery report](/docs/sms/api-reference/sms/tag/Delivery-reports/#tag/Delivery-reports/operation/GetDeliveryReportByBatchId) or sent to a [callback](/docs/sms/api-reference/sms/tag/Delivery-reports/#tag/Delivery-reports/paths/deliveryReport/post).

    ### Delivery Report Statuses

    The status field describes which state a particular message is in. Note that statuses of type Intermediate will only be reported if you request a status of per recipient ([Retrieve a recipient delivery report](/docs/sms/api-reference/sms/tag/Delivery-reports/#tag/Delivery-reports/operation/GetDeliveryReportByPhoneNumber)) or use callbacks with per_receipient status.

    The following statuses are available when using the REST API:
    | Status     | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                     |
    | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Queued     | Intermediate | Message is queued within REST API system and will be dispatched according to the rate of the account.                                           |
    | Dispatched | Intermediate | Message has been dispatched and accepted for delivery by the SMSC.                                                                              |
    | Aborted    | Final        | Message was aborted before reaching the SMSC.                                                                                                   |
    | Cancelled  | Final        | Message was cancelled before reaching the SMSC.                                                                                                 |
    | Rejected   | Final        | Message was rejected by the SMSC.                                                                                                               |
    | Deleted    | Final        | Message has been deleted. Message was deleted by a remote SMSC. This may happen if the destination is an invalid MSISDN or opted out subscriber.|
    | Delivered  | Final        | Message has been delivered.                                                                                                                     |
    | Failed     | Final        | Message failed to be delivered.                                                                                                                 |
    | Expired    | Final        | Message expired after delivery to the SMSC.                                                                                                     |
    | Unknown    | Final        | Message was delivered to the SMSC but no Delivery Receipt has been received or a Delivery Receipt that couldn't be interpreted was received.    |

    ### Delivery Report Error Codes

    The delivery report status code provides a more detailed view of what happened with a message. The REST API shares most of its error codes with other SMS services.

    In addition to these standard error codes, the REST API provides an additional set of error codes, all within the 4xx range (vendor specific errors in the range of 0x400 to 0x4FF as referenced in the SMPP specification). These are listed below:

    | Status Code (Hex) | Name                         | Status     | Description                                                                                                             |
    | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 400               | Queued                       | Queued     | Message is queued within REST API system and will be dispatched according to the rate of the account.                   |
    | 401               | Dispatched                   | Dispatched | Message has been dispatched to SMSC.                                                                                    |
    | 402               | Message unroutable           | Aborted    | SMSC rejected message. Retrying is likely to cause the same error.                                                      |
    | 403               | Internal error               | Aborted    | An unexpected error caused the message to fail.                                                                         |
    | 404               | Temporary delivery failure   | Aborted    | Message failed because of temporary delivery failure. Message can be retried.                                           |
    | 405               | Unmatched Parameter          | Aborted    | One or more parameters in the message body has no mapping for this recipient. See [Parameterization](#parameterization) |
    | 406               | Internal Expiry              | Aborted    | Message was expired before reaching SMSC. This may happen if the expiry time for the message was very short.            |
    | 407               | Cancelled                    | Cancelled  | Message was cancelled by user before reaching SMSC.                                                                     |
    | 408               | Internal Reject              | Aborted    | SMSC rejected the message. Retrying is likely to cause the same error.                                                  |
    | 410               | Unmatched default originator | Aborted    | No default originator exists/configured for this recipient when sending message without originator.                     |
    | 411               | Exceeded parts limit         | Aborted    | Message failed as the number of message parts exceeds the defined max number of message parts.                          |
    | 412               | Unprovisioned region         | Aborted    | SMSC rejected the message. The account hasn't been provisioned for this region.                                         |
    | 413               | Blocked                      | Aborted    | The account is blocked. Reach out to support for help. Potentially out of credits.                                      |
    | 414               | Bad Media                    | Aborted    | MMS only, the request failed due to a bad media url, it could be that the url was unreachable or sent a bad response.   |
    | 415               | Delivery report Rejected     | Failed     | MMS only, message reached MMSC but was rejected by MMS gateway or mobile network.                                       |

      summary: Update a group
      description: |-
        With the update group operation, you can add and remove members in an existing group as well as rename the group.

        This method encompasses a few ways to update a group:

        1. By using `add` and `remove` arrays containing phone numbers, you control the group movements. Any list of valid numbers in E.164 format can be added.
        2. By using the `auto_update` object, your customer can add or remove themselves from groups.
        3. You can also add or remove other groups into this group with `add_from_group` and `remove_from_group`.

        #### Other group update info

        - The request will not be rejected for duplicate adds or unknown removes.
        - The additions will be done before the deletions. If an phone number is on both lists, it will not be apart of the resulting group.
        - Updating a group targeted by a batch message scheduled in the future is allowed. Changes will be reflected when the batch is sent.

        A batch can be canceled at any point. If a batch is canceled while it's currently being delivered some messages currently being processed might still be delivered. The delivery report will indicate which messages were canceled and which weren't.

        Canceling a batch scheduled in the future will result in an empty delivery report while canceling an already sent batch would result in no change to the completed delivery report.

      summary: Create a group
      description: |-
        This endpoint allows you to create a group of recipients.  A new group must be created with a group name. This is represented by the `name` field which can be up to 20 charecters. In addition, there are a number of optional fields:
          - `members` field enables groups to be created with an initial list of contacts
          - `auto_update` allows customers to auto subscribe to a new group. This contains three fields. The `to` field contains the group creator's number. (This number **must be provisioned by contacting your account manager**.) The `add` and `remove` fields are objects containing the keywords that customers need to text to join or leave a group.

      summary: Send delivery feedback for a message
      description: |-
        Send feedback if your system can confirm successful message delivery.

        Feedback can only be provided if `feedback_enabled` was set when batch was submitted.

        **Batches**: It is possible to submit feedback multiple times for the same batch for different recipients. Feedback without specified recipients is treated as successful message delivery to all recipients referenced in the batch. Note that the `recipients` key is still required even if the value is empty.

        **Groups**: If the batch message was creating using a group ID, at least one recipient is required. Excluding recipients (an empty recipient list) does not work and will result in a failed request.    delivery-reports: Delivery reports can be retrieved even if no callback was requested. The difference between a summary and a full report is only that the full report contains the phone numbers in [E.164](https://community.sinch.com/t5/Glossary/E-164/ta-p/7537) format for each status code.
